Basing the diet on plant-based whole foods will help to reduce nutritional stress, and thereby overall stress. With less stress comes: improved sleep quality (and therefore less needed), more energy without dependence on stimulants such as coffee and sugar, reduced body fat, enhanced mental clarity, a boost in productivity, and the ability to breakthrough to higher levels of athletic performance with less training.",
