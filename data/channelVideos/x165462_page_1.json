If you're following a training plan and working hard, but still aren't achieving the gains you're hoping for (or think you deserve), nutrition\u2014and how it's timed relative to the stages of your workout\u2014could be the missing piece\n\nWhen you eat is just as important as what you eat\n\nPerformance nutrition should play a significant role in your training routine. Your body has specific nutritional needs before, during and after your workout. Before you work out, your body needs fuel. It can use a balance of high- and low-glycemic carbs. During your workout, carbs also help you go the distance. Refueling every 45 minutes with easily digested carbs is recommended. \n\nEvery athlete is unique, so it's important that you listen to your body, as your fuel needs can change over time and vary depending on the duration and intensity of your workout. After your workout, your body needs to replenish and repair. Replenish muscle glycogen with a 4-to-1 ratio of carbs-to-protein within a 20 minute window. Then repair and build muscles with clean, plant-based protein and BCAAs within 45 minutes of your workout (be sure to space your protein at least 20 minutes after your 4-to-1 replenishment for best results). \n\nTo learn more about the Vega Sport System\u2014and products that could benefit training at all stages of your workout\u2014check out www.VegaSport.com",

If you're training more and more and more, and you're not getting any closer to your goals, you might have reached a plateau from overtraining.\n\nTrain less, recover more\n\nIt's possible to train too much. While it may seem counter-intuitive, achieving more might mean training less and recovering more. Taking a rest day could get you closer to your goals than pushing through. It's also important to focus on active recovery techniques such as cooling down, stretching and foam rolling. \n\nRecovery nutrition \n\nIf you've pushed yourself too hard, too often, start focusing on proactive post-workout replenishment. In the first 20 minutes after your workout, consume a 4-to-1 ratio of carbs-to-protein. This ratio replenishes muscle glycogen faster than carbs alone for your next workout. To support muscle repair, post-workout protein and BCAAs provides the materials your body needs to come back stronger. Time your post-workout protein at least 20 minutes after supplementing (or eating) your 4-to-1 carb-to-protein.\n\nTo learn how the Vega Sport Nutrition System supports recovery, and benefits your training, check out VegaSport.com.",

However, the faster (and more effectively) you recover between workouts, the faster you can train again. And the faster you can make gains.\n\nTraining gains without pain\n\nReducing muscle soreness can start even before you work out. Don't underestimate the value of warming up with active stretching. Focus on cooling down, stretching, and foam rolling after your workout. If you have problematic areas\u2014like knees\u2014invest training time in strengthening the supporting muscles around the area.\n\nReduce inflammation to reduce muscle soreness \n\nQuality nutrition is a powerful strategy for speeding recovery. Often muscle soreness is caused by inflammation. Plant-based foods that are rich in antioxidants and healthy fats to support inflammation management. Natural herbs and supplements can also help with inflammation. Curcumin\u2014the active component of turmeric\u2014is a powerful inflammation fighter. \n\nTo learn how the Vega Sport Nutrition System supports all stages of your workout, check out VegaSport.com.",

By increasing your strength-to-weight ratio, you can take your performance to the next level.\n\nTraining to Get Stronger and Leaner \n\nEven if you're an endurance athlete, it's important to cross-train with weights and High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). Your goal is not to add bulk but to improve your strength level andyour ratio of lean muscle to body fat. Both weight training and HIIT complement endurance training to build a leaner, stronger body that can go faster and farther. \n\nEating to Get Stronger and Leaner\n\nIf you're eating a clean, plant-based diet you are able to maximize your nutrition for relatively few calories. Dietary protein supports the development of lean muscle when combined with strength training, and the timing of protein after your workout is crucial. You may be worried about getting enough protein with your increased cross-training. Don't worry\u2014it's easy to combine carbs with protein in a 4-to-1 carb-to-protein ratio immediately after a workout then follow with protein and BCAAs at least 20 minutes later (45 minutes post-workout).\n\nTo learn how the Vega Sport Nutrition System supports recovery, and benefits your training, check out VegaSport.com.",

If you've been fueling sufficiently, and you're still struggling to go the distance, you're likely dealing with insufficient endurance or stamina. \n\nTraining to build up stamina\n\nIf you're working on a new distance goal (e.g., you're graduating from half-marathons to full marathons), you'll need to build up stamina. By increasing both endurance and strength you'll improve stamina. The first half of stamina training is to put in the days and train at a lower intensity for longer time. Gradual increases are the most effective way to increase endurance. Aim for a 10% increase in mileage or duration per week. The second half of stamina training is to cross-train for strength. \n\nCaffeine for stamina \n\nSupport your endurance training with a little pre-workout caffeine\u2014known for enhancing endurance performance. Choose a holistic stimulant such as green tea or yerba mat\u00e9.\nTo learn how the Vega Sport Nutrition System supports all stages of your workout, check out VegaSport.com.",

Whether you've hit a training plateau, are mentally and physically exhausted, or sick of the weather, it's normal to need an extra boost of motivation every now and again. \n\nBoost motivation with training\n\nSometimes a simple change in routine can shake you out of a rut. Whether you switch up the distance, intensity, time of day, duration or frequency, cross-training to switch your pattern can result in motivation gains. It also never hurts to grab a buddy to be accountable to.\n\nBoost motivation with caffeine\n\nCaffeine is a well-known performance enhancer. Not only does it support endurance, but it also helps with mental focus.

Usually we think of lactic acid as a bad thing (it burns\u2014and it can stop you in your tracks!) but you can actually think of it as stored energy.\n\nDuring aerobic exercise your body makes energy from stored glycogen or consumed glucose and oxygen. During an all-out sprint (anaerobic exercise) your body has to switch paths and makes lactic acid (in the absence of oxygen). Although it burns, once your pace slows (and oxygen returns), your body is able to reconvert energy stored as lactic acid into fuel.  \n\nTrain to increase your lactate threshold \n\nThe only way to completely avoid the burn of lactic acid is to avoid anaerobic activities that bring it on. But best way to decrease the burn is to increase your lactate threshold. Your lactate threshold is the point at which your body has to produce lactic acid. You can postpone this burn with high-intensity pace runs or fartliks.\n\nNutrition to decrease muscle burn \n\nLactic acid is more likely to affect you if you're dehydrated. It's easier for your body to cope with the pH change from lactic acid\u2014 and to clear away waste\u2014when you're adequately hydrated. Ensure you're hydrated with more than water. Replenish important electrolytes: sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride.\n\nTo learn how the Vega Sport Nutrition System can support you mid-workout, check out VegaSport.com.",

If you've suffered from a drastic drop in energy levels, impaired decision making, and had your muscles suddenly stop listening, you know what it means to bonk or hit the wall. Generally, this is caused by a complete depletion of stored glucose\u2014in the form of muscle glycogen and a subsequent drop in blood sugar, bringing you to a complete halt. \n\nFueling to avoid the wall \n\nIf you've eaten well and recovered between workouts, you have about an hour of stored glycogen. Therefore, exercise beyond one hour requires additional fuel to avoid bonking. Carbohydrates are your body's preferred choice of fuel. The higher your exercise intensity, the greater your need for carbs.  As a general rule, consume easily-digested carbs every 45 minutes. Ease of digestion is important during activity so blood flow is not diverted away from your limbs to your digestive system.\n\nTo learn how the Vega Sport Nutrition System can support you before, during and after your workout, visit VegaSport.com.",
