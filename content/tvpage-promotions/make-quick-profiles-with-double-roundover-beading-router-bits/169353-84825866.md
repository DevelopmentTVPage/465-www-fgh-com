Removable shims allow you to adjust the distance between cutters. You can remove the shims to create a full bullnose profile. Or combine cutters from different bits to create one-of-a-kind profiles like a thumbnail table edge. Andrew Gibson provides an overview of how you can put these bits to use in your shop.",
